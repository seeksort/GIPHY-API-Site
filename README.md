# GIPHY API Site

A web page that uses the GIPHY API to pull GIFs corresponding to dynamically-generated buttons. Enjoy GIFs from a selection of classic anime series, or add your own!

I learned more about properly using click handlers, and much more about simplifying code. In a previous commit, I had tried to decompose everything into a bunch of functions. It worked, but it seemed too unwieldy for something that really only has functions execute for three event listeners, with no overlap. Sometimes simpler is better.
